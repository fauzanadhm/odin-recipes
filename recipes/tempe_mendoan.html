    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            8 oz tempeh
        </li>
        <li>
            Cooking oil for deep-frying
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ cup rice flour
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ Tbsp baking powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tsp salt
        </li>
        <li>
            1 clove garlic finely minced
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tsp coriander powder
        </li>
        <li>
            ¾ cup ice-cold water
        </li>
        <li>
            1 stalk scallion finely chopped
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ tsp turmeric powder
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the tempeh into thin wide slices</li>
        <li>Preheat about 2 inches of oil in a deep pot for deep frying. While the oil is heating, mix all the
            ingredients for batter, except for ice cold water. Stir to mix everything. When the oil is hot and ready,
            pour in the ice cold water and whisk to mix, do not over stir. a little bit of lump is perfectly fine. Coat
            each slice of the thin tempeh with batter and carefully lower into the hot oil and let it fry until golden
            brown on one side and then use a tong to carefully flip to the other side. The idea is just to fry until the
            batter is crispy, but the tempeh inside isn't necessarily all crispy and dry. Remove from the oil into an
            absorbent paper towel. Repeat with the rest.</li>
